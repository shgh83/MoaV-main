## Do I Need a Domain?

**No.** MoaV can run without a domain in **domain-less mode**. A domain unlocks more protocols, but several work with just an IP address.

| Protocol | Requires Domain | Port |
|----------|:-:|------|
| Reality (VLESS) | No | 443/tcp |
| WireGuard | No | 51820/udp |
| WireGuard (wstunnel) | No | 8080/tcp |
| AmneziaWG | No | 51821/udp |
| Telegram MTProxy (telemt) | No | 993/tcp |
| Admin Dashboard | No | 9443/tcp |
| Conduit (Psiphon donation) | No | — |
| Snowflake (Tor donation) | No | — |
| Trojan | **Yes** | 8443/tcp |
| Hysteria2 | **Yes** | 443/udp |
| TrustTunnel | **Yes** | 4443/tcp+udp |
| CDN (VLESS+WebSocket) | **Yes** (Cloudflare) | 2082/tcp |
| dnstt (DNS tunnel) | **Yes** (NS records) | 53/udp |
| Slipstream (QUIC-over-DNS) | **Yes** (NS records) | 53/udp |

**Domain-dependent protocols** need a valid TLS certificate (via Let's Encrypt) or NS delegation, which both require a domain.

---

## Domain-less Mode

Leave `DOMAIN=` empty in your `.env` file. MoaV automatically detects this and runs only protocols that work without a domain:

- **Reality** — VLESS with TLS camouflage (uses `REALITY_TARGET` like `dl.google.com` instead of your own domain)
- **WireGuard** — Full VPN, direct UDP or tunneled over WebSocket (TCP) when UDP is blocked
- **AmneziaWG** — DPI-resistant WireGuard with packet-level obfuscation
- **Telegram MTProxy** — Direct Telegram access via fake-TLS, no VPN needed
- **Admin Dashboard** — Web UI with self-signed certificate
- **Conduit / Snowflake** — Bandwidth donation (optional)

This is ideal for:
- **Raspberry Pi** or home servers without a registered domain
- Quick deployments when you can't register a domain
- Environments where only VPN-style protocols are needed

You can upgrade to a full domain setup later — just set `DOMAIN=` in `.env` and run `moav bootstrap`.

### Port Forwarding (Domain-less)

If running on a home network, forward these ports on your router:

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 443/tcp | TCP | Reality (VLESS) |
| 51820/udp | UDP | WireGuard |
| 8080/tcp | TCP | wstunnel (WireGuard over WebSocket) |
| 51821/udp | UDP | AmneziaWG |
| 993/tcp | TCP | Telegram MTProxy |
| 9443/tcp | TCP | Admin Dashboard |

> No port 80 needed — domain-less mode doesn't use Let's Encrypt.

---

## Domain Setup

If you have a domain, you unlock all 13+ protocols. How many DNS records you need depends on which features you enable.

### Minimum Setup (Without DNS Tunnels)

If you don't need DNS tunnels (dnstt / Slipstream), you only need one record:

```
Type: A
Name: @ (or your domain name)
Value: YOUR_SERVER_IP
TTL: 300 (or Auto)
```

This enables: Reality, Trojan, Hysteria2, TrustTunnel, CDN mode, and all domain-less protocols.

### Full Setup (With DNS Tunnels)

#### Step 1: Main A Record

```
Type: A
Name: @ (or your domain name)
Value: YOUR_SERVER_IP
TTL: 300
```

#### Step 2: DNS Server A Record

```
Type: A
Name: dns
Value: YOUR_SERVER_IP
TTL: 300
```

This creates `dns.yourdomain.com` pointing to your server (used as the nameserver for tunnel subdomains).

#### Step 3: NS Delegation for dnstt

```
Type: NS
Name: t
Value: dns.yourdomain.com
TTL: 300
```

This tells DNS resolvers that queries for `*.t.yourdomain.com` should be sent to `dns.yourdomain.com` (your server). Used by dnstt.

#### Step 4: NS Delegation for Slipstream (Optional)

```
Type: NS
Name: s
Value: dns.yourdomain.com
TTL: 300
```

Same concept as dnstt, but for the Slipstream QUIC-over-DNS tunnel. Slipstream is 1.5-5x faster than dnstt. Only needed if `ENABLE_SLIPSTREAM=true`.

#### Optional: IPv6 Support

If your server has IPv6, you can also add an AAAA record for the nameserver:

```
Type: AAAA
Name: dns
Value: YOUR_SERVER_IPV6
TTL: 300
```

> **More Info**: For detailed dnstt documentation, see the [official dnstt guide](https://www.bamsoftware.com/software/dnstt/).

### Summary of All DNS Records

| Record | Name | Value | Proxy | Purpose | Required? |
|--------|------|-------|-------|---------|-----------|
| A | `@` | Server IP | DNS only | Main domain (Trojan, Hysteria2, Reality) | Yes |
| A | `dns` | Server IP | DNS only | Nameserver for DNS tunnels | Only for dnstt/Slipstream |
| NS | `t` | `dns.domain.com` | — | dnstt tunnel subdomain | Only for dnstt |
| NS | `s` | `dns.domain.com` | — | Slipstream tunnel subdomain | Only for Slipstream |
| A | `cdn` | Server IP | **Proxied** | CDN-fronted VLESS | Only for CDN mode |
| A | `www` | Server IP | **Proxied** | CDN stealth connect address | Optional (CDN stealth) |
| A | `grafana` | Server IP | **Proxied** | Grafana via CDN | Optional (monitoring) |

---

## Provider-Specific Instructions

### Cloudflare

1. Log into Cloudflare Dashboard
2. Select your domain
3. Go to DNS → Records
4. Add records:

**Important:** Set proxy status to "DNS only" (gray cloud) for most records. Only CDN-related records should be "Proxied" (orange cloud).

| Type | Name | Content | Proxy status |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| A | @ | YOUR_IP | DNS only |
| A | dns | YOUR_IP | DNS only |
| NS | t | dns.yourdomain.com | — |
| NS | s | dns.yourdomain.com | — |
| A | cdn | YOUR_IP | **Proxied** (orange cloud) |
| A | www | YOUR_IP | **Proxied** (orange cloud) |
| A | grafana | YOUR_IP | **Proxied** (orange cloud) |

> The `cdn`, `www`, and `grafana` records are optional:
> - `cdn` — Required if you want CDN-fronted VLESS (`ENABLE_CDN=true` or CDN_SUBDOMAIN set)
> - `www` — Recommended for CDN stealth. Used as the CDN connect address so DNS queries don't reveal the "cdn" subdomain to DPI. Set `CDN_ADDRESS=www.yourdomain.com` in `.env`
> - `grafana` — Only needed if you want faster Grafana loading via CDN (see [Monitoring Guide](MONITORING.md#cloudflare-cdn-for-faster-grafana-recommended))
>
> All other records **must** be DNS only (gray cloud).

#### CDN Origin Rule (Required for CDN Mode)

If you added the `cdn` record above, you **must** also create an Origin Rule to redirect traffic to port 2082. By default, Cloudflare's Flexible SSL connects to origin port 80, but MoaV's CDN listener runs on port 2082.

**Step 1: Go to Rules → Origin Rules**

1. In Cloudflare Dashboard, select your domain
2. Navigate to **Rules** → **Origin Rules**
3. Click **Create rule**

**Step 2: Configure the Rule**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Rule name | `CDN to port 2082` |
| When incoming requests match... | **Hostname** equals `cdn.yourdomain.com` |
| Then... | **Destination Port** → Rewrite to `2082` |

**Step 3: Deploy**

Click **Deploy** to activate the rule.

**Verify it works:**
```bash
# Should return HTTP 400 (sing-box responding, not Cloudflare 521)
# Use any path - the CDN WS path is auto-generated during bootstrap
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://cdn.yourdomain.com/test
```

A `400` or `404` response means sing-box is receiving the request.
- `521` = Origin Rule is missing or misconfigured
- `525` = SSL mode is wrong — set Cloudflare SSL/TLS to **Flexible** (not Full/Strict), because MoaV's CDN port 2082 is plain HTTP

> **Important:** Cloudflare SSL/TLS mode must be set to **Flexible** for CDN mode. MoaV's CDN inbound on port 2082 is plain HTTP (Cloudflare terminates TLS). If you need Full SSL for other subdomains, use a Configuration Rule to set Flexible for just `cdn.yourdomain.com`.

See [CDN Setup Guide](SETUP.md#cdn-fronted-vlesswebsocket-cloudflare) for complete CDN configuration.

### Namecheap

1. Log into Namecheap
2. Domain List → Manage → Advanced DNS
3. Add records:

| Type | Host | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A Record | @ | YOUR_IP | Automatic |
| A Record | dns | YOUR_IP | Automatic |
| NS Record | t | dns.yourdomain.com. | Automatic |
| NS Record | s | dns.yourdomain.com. | Automatic |

Note: NS value may need trailing dot. The `dns`, `t`, and `s` records are only needed if using DNS tunnels.

### Google Domains / Squarespace

1. Go to DNS settings
2. Add custom records:

| Host name | Type | TTL | Data |
|-----------|------|-----|------|
| (blank) | A | 300 | YOUR_IP |
| dns | A | 300 | YOUR_IP |
| t | NS | 300 | dns.yourdomain.com |
| s | NS | 300 | dns.yourdomain.com |

### Hetzner DNS

1. Go to DNS Console
2. Select your zone
3. Add records:

```
@ IN A YOUR_IP
dns IN A YOUR_IP
t IN NS dns.yourdomain.com.
s IN NS dns.yourdomain.com.
```

## Home Servers & Raspberry Pi

MoaV runs on Raspberry Pi 4+ (2GB+ RAM) and any ARM64/x64 Linux machine. Home servers typically have dynamic IPs and sit behind a router, so you need port forwarding and (if using a domain) Dynamic DNS.

### Port Forwarding

Configure your router to forward the ports you need to your MoaV server's local IP.

**Domain-less mode** (minimum):

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 443/tcp | TCP | Reality (VLESS) |
| 51820/udp | UDP | WireGuard |
| 8080/tcp | TCP | wstunnel (WireGuard over WebSocket) |
| 51821/udp | UDP | AmneziaWG |
| 993/tcp | TCP | Telegram MTProxy |
| 9443/tcp | TCP | Admin Dashboard |

**With domain** (add these):

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 80/tcp | TCP | Let's Encrypt verification (only during certificate setup/renewal) |
| 443/udp | UDP | Hysteria2 |
| 8443/tcp | TCP | Trojan |
| 4443/tcp | TCP | TrustTunnel (HTTP/2) |
| 4443/udp | UDP | TrustTunnel (HTTP/3 / QUIC) |
| 53/udp | UDP | DNS tunnels (dnstt + Slipstream) |

**Optional**:

| Port | Protocol | Service |
|------|----------|---------|
| 9444/tcp | TCP | Grafana monitoring dashboard |

> Only forward ports for protocols you actually enable. Check your `.env` file for `ENABLE_*` toggles.

### Before You Start

1. **Check for CGNAT**: Some ISPs use Carrier-Grade NAT which prevents incoming connections entirely. Test by comparing your router's WAN IP with `curl ipinfo.io/ip`. If they differ, contact your ISP for a public IP or use a VPS instead.

2. **Static local IP**: Assign a static IP to your MoaV server in your router's DHCP settings so port forwarding rules don't break when the local IP changes.

### Dynamic DNS (DDNS)

If you're using a domain with a home server, your ISP likely assigns a dynamic public IP that changes periodically. Dynamic DNS services automatically update your domain to point to your current IP.

> **Domain-less mode does not need DDNS.** Users connect via your public IP directly. You can find your current public IP with `curl ifconfig.me` and share it manually. If your IP changes, update the configs you shared.

### DuckDNS (Free)

DuckDNS is a free DDNS service that provides subdomains like `yourname.duckdns.org`. Let's Encrypt works with DuckDNS domains.

#### Step 1: Create Account

1. Go to [duckdns.org](https://www.duckdns.org/)
2. Sign in with Google, GitHub, Twitter, or Reddit
3. Create a subdomain (e.g., `myvpn` → `myvpn.duckdns.org`)
4. Copy your **token** from the dashboard

#### Step 2: Install Update Script

On your MoaV server (Raspberry Pi or home server):

```bash
# Create update script
mkdir -p /opt/duckdns
cat > /opt/duckdns/duck.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
DOMAIN="YOUR_SUBDOMAIN"  # e.g., myvpn (without .duckdns.org)
TOKEN="YOUR_TOKEN"

curl -s "https://www.duckdns.org/update?domains=${DOMAIN}&token=${TOKEN}&ip=" | logger -t duckdns
EOF

# Replace with your values
nano /opt/duckdns/duck.sh

# Make executable
chmod +x /opt/duckdns/duck.sh

# Test it
/opt/duckdns/duck.sh
```

#### Step 3: Schedule Automatic Updates

```bash
# Add to crontab (runs every 5 minutes)
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * /opt/duckdns/duck.sh") | crontab -
```

#### Step 4: Configure MoaV

In your `.env` file:
```bash
DOMAIN=yourname.duckdns.org
```

Then run bootstrap as normal.

> **Note:** DuckDNS subdomains don't support NS delegation, so DNS tunnels (dnstt, Slipstream) won't work with DuckDNS. All other domain-based protocols work fine.

### Cloudflare DDNS (Own Domain)

If you have your own domain on Cloudflare, you can use the Cloudflare API to update DNS records automatically. This supports all features including DNS tunnels.

#### Step 1: Get API Token

1. Go to [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) → My Profile → API Tokens
2. Create a token with **Zone:DNS:Edit** permission for your domain
3. Copy the token

#### Step 2: Get Zone ID

1. Go to your domain in Cloudflare
2. Scroll down on the Overview page
3. Copy the **Zone ID** from the right sidebar

#### Step 3: Install Update Script

```bash
mkdir -p /opt/cloudflare-ddns
cat > /opt/cloudflare-ddns/update.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
CF_API_TOKEN="YOUR_API_TOKEN"
CF_ZONE_ID="YOUR_ZONE_ID"
DOMAIN="yourdomain.com"
RECORD_NAME="@"  # Use "@" for root domain or "subdomain" for subdomain

# Get current public IP
CURRENT_IP=$(curl -s https://api.ipify.org)

# Get current DNS record
RECORD_DATA=$(curl -s -X GET "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CF_ZONE_ID}/dns_records?type=A&name=${DOMAIN}" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CF_API_TOKEN}" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json")

RECORD_ID=$(echo "$RECORD_DATA" | grep -o '"id":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)
RECORD_IP=$(echo "$RECORD_DATA" | grep -o '"content":"[^"]*"' | head -1 | cut -d'"' -f4)

# Update if IP changed
if [ "$CURRENT_IP" != "$RECORD_IP" ]; then
    echo "IP changed from $RECORD_IP to $CURRENT_IP, updating..."
    curl -s -X PUT "https://api.cloudflare.com/client/v4/zones/${CF_ZONE_ID}/dns_records/${RECORD_ID}" \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer ${CF_API_TOKEN}" \
        -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
        --data "{\"type\":\"A\",\"name\":\"${DOMAIN}\",\"content\":\"${CURRENT_IP}\",\"ttl\":300,\"proxied\":false}" | logger -t cloudflare-ddns
else
    echo "IP unchanged ($CURRENT_IP)"
fi
EOF

# Edit with your values
nano /opt/cloudflare-ddns/update.sh

chmod +x /opt/cloudflare-ddns/update.sh
```

#### Step 4: Schedule Updates

```bash
# Run every 5 minutes
(crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "*/5 * * * * /opt/cloudflare-ddns/update.sh") | crontab -
```

#### Step 5: Configure MoaV

In your `.env`:
```bash
DOMAIN=yourdomain.com
```

### After DDNS Setup

1. **Wait for propagation**: After the first update, wait 5-10 minutes
2. **Verify**: `dig +short yourdomain.com` should show your home IP
3. **Run MoaV setup**: `moav` to start the interactive setup
4. **Test from outside**: Use mobile data (not home WiFi) to test connectivity

### Home Server Tips

- **UPS recommended**: Protect against power outages, especially for Raspberry Pi
- **Monitor uptime**: Use a free service like [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to alert you if your server goes down
- **Backup regularly**: `moav export` to backup your configuration
- **Temperature**: Ensure adequate cooling for Raspberry Pi under sustained VPN load
- **SD card**: Use a high-endurance microSD card or boot from USB/SSD for reliability

---

## Verification

After configuring DNS, wait for propagation (usually 5-30 minutes, up to 48 hours).

### Verify A Record

```bash
dig +short yourdomain.com
# Should return: YOUR_SERVER_IP

dig +short dns.yourdomain.com
# Should return: YOUR_SERVER_IP
```

### Verify NS Delegation

```bash
dig NS t.yourdomain.com
# Should show: dns.yourdomain.com in AUTHORITY SECTION

# Test that queries reach your server
dig @YOUR_SERVER_IP test.t.yourdomain.com
# Should get a response (after dnstt is running)
```

### Online Tools

- https://dnschecker.org - Check propagation worldwide
- https://mxtoolbox.com/DNSLookup.aspx - Detailed DNS lookup

## Common Issues

### "DNS not propagated yet"

Wait longer (up to 48 hours in rare cases). Check with multiple DNS servers:

```bash
dig @8.8.8.8 yourdomain.com
dig @1.1.1.1 yourdomain.com
```

### "NS record not working"

- Ensure the A record for `dns.yourdomain.com` exists
- Some registrars require a trailing dot: `dns.yourdomain.com.`
- NS delegation can take longer to propagate

### "Certificate acquisition failed"

- Verify A record is correct: `dig yourdomain.com`
- Ensure port 80 is open (temporarily, for ACME HTTP-01)
- Check that no other service is using port 80
- Not applicable in domain-less mode (no certificates needed)

### "Can't connect from outside my home network"

- Verify port forwarding is configured on your router
- Check for CGNAT: `curl ifconfig.me` should match your router's WAN IP
- Ensure your ISP doesn't block the ports you need
- Test from mobile data, not your home WiFi

## Domain Acquisition Tips

For users in censored regions:

1. **Use privacy protection** - Hide your personal info in WHOIS
2. **Pay with crypto** if possible - For anonymity
3. **Choose a neutral TLD** - `.com`, `.net`, `.org` are less suspicious than country-specific TLDs
4. **Avoid "VPN" or "proxy" in the domain name** - Keep it generic
5. **Consider multiple domains** - Have backups ready if one gets blocked

### Domain Naming Strategy

Your domain name is the first thing DPI systems see in the TLS SNI. A good domain blends with legitimate traffic:

**Good examples:**
- Names that look like business infrastructure: `cloudops-services.com`, `cdn-platform.net`
- Names that look like SaaS products: `dataflow-sync.com`, `metrics-hub.net`
- Generic tech names: `stackbuilder.io`, `nodebridge.net`

**Bad examples:**
- Anything with "vpn", "proxy", "tunnel", "free", "bypass" in the name
- Random strings: `xk4m2p.com` (suspicious to automated systems)
- Known circumvention patterns: `v2ray-server.com`

**Subdomain naming** also matters. MoaV's CDN subdomain defaults to `cdn` — consider changing it to something like `assets`, `static`, `api`, or `app` in your `.env`:
```bash
CDN_SUBDOMAIN=assets
```

### Recommended Registrars

- Namecheap - Good privacy, accepts crypto
- Porkbun - Cheap, good privacy
- Njalla - Maximum privacy (they own the domain for you)

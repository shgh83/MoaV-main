# Changelog

All notable changes to MoaV will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.4] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **Auto-detect missing `.env` variables** — `moav update` now compares your `.env` with `.env.example` and offers to auto-add new variables with defaults (timestamped separator for easy review)
- **CDN WS path auto-generation** — Bootstrap generates a random realistic API-like path (e.g., `/api/v3/storage/download/update-bundle-4821.bin`) instead of the obvious `/ws`, persisted in state for consistency across regenerations
- **HTTPUpgrade as default CDN transport** — Less fingerprinted by DPI than WebSocket; configurable via `CDN_TRANSPORT` env var (`httpupgrade` or `ws`)
- **TLS fingerprint randomization** — All protocols now use `fp=random` (rotates real browser fingerprints: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) instead of hardcoded `chrome`
- **Domain naming strategy guide** — New section in DNS docs with good/bad domain name examples and CDN subdomain advice for DPI evasion
- **CDN split SNI/Address/Host** — Client configs now use root domain as TLS SNI (less suspicious to DPI than `cdn.domain.com`), with CDN subdomain only in the encrypted Host header for Cloudflare routing. Optional `CDN_ADDRESS` for full domain separation (`CDN_SNI`, `CDN_ADDRESS` env vars)
- **Cloudflare SSL Flexible requirement** — Added clear documentation about SSL mode requirement across DNS, Setup, and Troubleshooting docs (prevents 525 errors)
- **Shell autocompletion** — `moav install` now installs bash/zsh completions for all commands, subcommands, services, profiles, and protocols; `moav uninstall` removes them
- **Admin dashboard redesign** — Services displayed as cards with auto-fill grid layout, green border for running services; favicon and logo in browser tab/header; centered footer with version and GitHub link
- **`moav user revoke` telemt support** — Revoking a user now removes their MTProxy secret from all three telemt config sections and restarts telemt

### Fixed
- **`moav update` crashing silently** — `check_component_versions()` failed under `set -euo pipefail` when version variables (e.g., `TELEMT_VERSION`, `SLIPSTREAM_VERSION`) were missing from older `.env` files; grep returning exit code 1 killed the script before reaching `check_env_additions()`
- **`moav logs <service>` showing all containers** — Service names like `slipstream` were resolved as profile aliases (→ `dnstunnel`), causing `--profile dnstunnel` to show all DNS tunnel services; now checks exact profile names first, then falls back to service resolution
- **Domainless mode `unbound variable` crash** — `TROJAN_LINK`, `HY2_LINK`, and their IPv6 variants were referenced unconditionally but only set when a domain is configured; all references now guarded with `[[ -n "${VAR:-}" ]]`
- **`moav uninstall` aborting on root-owned files** — Docker-created files under `configs/`, `state/`, `outputs/` are owned by root; `set -euo pipefail` + `rm` = permission denied = script abort; now uses `_wrm()` helper with sudo fallback
- **Permission denied on `state/users/` and `configs/`** — Docker containers create directories as root; non-root users couldn't write when adding/revoking users; added sudo mkdir/chmod fallback in user-add and user-revoke scripts
- **`mv` interactive prompt on Debian/Ubuntu** — Default `mv -i` alias caused scripts to hang waiting for confirmation; all `mv` calls now use `mv -f` across all scripts
- **`xxd: command not found` on minimal systems** — Replaced all `xxd -p` usage with POSIX-portable `od -An -tx1 | tr -d ' \n'` (xxd requires vim package, not installed on minimal Raspberry Pi OS)
- **Docker Compose service status checks always returning true** — `docker compose ps --status running` returns exit code 0 with only a header row even when no containers match; all service-running checks now use `tail -n +2 | grep -q .` to skip the header and verify actual container output exists
- **User add failing when WireGuard not running** — Config file existing was enough to trigger WireGuard peer add attempt; now checks if the Docker service is actually running first, skips gracefully with info message if not
- **Snowflake dashboard false positive** — `check_service_status("snowflake")` was hardcoded to return `"running"`; changed to `"unknown"` with distinct `?` indicator and hover tooltip explaining host networking limitation
- **AmneziaWG `awg` binary missing from Docker image** — Built in multi-stage builder but never copied to final image; added `COPY --from=builder /usr/bin/awg /usr/bin/awg`
- **Grafana dashboard starring silently failing** — `star_dashboards()` used GNU wget flags (`--user`, `--password`, `--auth-no-challenge`) unsupported by BusyBox wget in the official Grafana Alpine image; replaced with `--header "Authorization: Basic ..."` which works everywhere. Also added missing `moav-amneziawg` to star list
- **Dashboard user protocol tags incomplete** — telemt detection checked wrong filename (`telegram-mtproxy.txt` instead of `telegram-proxy-link.txt`); added missing dnstt and Slipstream protocol detection

### Changed
- **CDN bundle files renamed** — `cdn-vless-ws-singbox.json` → `cdn-vless-singbox.json`, `cdn-vless-ws.txt` → `cdn-vless.txt` (reflects transport-agnostic naming)

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- **Telegram MTProxy (telemt)** — Rust-based MTProxy with Fake-TLS V2 for direct Telegram access in censored regions
  - New `telemt` service on port 993/tcp (IMAPS port — blends with expected TLS traffic)
  - Fake-TLS V2: real certificate emulation, timing simulation, ALPN enforcement (mimics `dl.google.com`)
  - Per-user 32-hex secrets with configurable connection limits (`TELEMT_MAX_TCP_CONNS`, `TELEMT_MAX_UNIQUE_IPS`)
  - `tg://proxy` and `https://t.me/proxy` links auto-generated in user bundles with QR codes
  - No domain required — works with IP address only (fake-TLS domain is for DPI evasion, not DNS)
  - No client binary needed — users connect via official Telegram app
  - Profile: `telegram` (aliases: `tg`, `mtproxy`, `telemt`)
  - `ENABLE_TELEMT=true` by default
- **Telegram MTProxy Grafana Dashboard** — Per-user connection monitoring
  - Active Users, Total/Bad Connections, Handshake Timeouts, Uptime stat panels
  - Connection Rate, Active Connections & Users, Bandwidth Rate time series
  - Per-user breakdown: Active Connections by User, Unique IPs by User
  - Per-User Details table and ME Health (Messaging Engine) charts
- **`moav user add` telemt integration** — New users automatically get MTProxy secrets and `tg://proxy` links

### Fixed
- **Grafana proxy 502 errors** — Race condition where grafana-proxy started before Grafana was ready; added readiness wait loop
- **Grafana dashboard starring fails on HTTPS** — `star_dashboards()` was using `http://` but Grafana runs HTTPS when certs are found; now uses matching protocol with `--no-check-certificate`
- **dnstt/Slipstream "cannot resolve sing-box" warning** — Race condition where DNS tunnels started before sing-box was registered in Docker DNS; added `depends_on: sing-box: condition: service_healthy`
- **telemt metrics not scraped by Prometheus** — telemt's `metrics_whitelist` defaults to localhost-only; added `metrics_whitelist = ["0.0.0.0/0"]` to generated config
- **`moav restart grafana` restarting entire monitoring stack** — Service names like `grafana`, `prometheus` were being resolved as profile aliases to `monitoring`; `restart`/`stop` now only match exact profile names
- **Slipstream build arguments** — Fixed build failures from incorrect argument passing

### Changed
- **Fake-TLS default domain** — Changed from `www.google.com` to `dl.google.com` (whitelisted during Iran's Jan-Feb 2026 shutdowns, less commonly used as proxy SNI fingerprint)
- **telemt per-user limits configurable** — `TELEMT_MAX_TCP_CONNS` (default: 100) and `TELEMT_MAX_UNIQUE_IPS` (default: 10) via `.env`

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- **Slipstream DNS Tunnel** — QUIC-over-DNS protocol (1.5-5x faster than dnstt)
  - New `slipstream` service using pre-built Rust binaries from [slipstream-rust](https://github.com/Mygod/slipstream-rust)
  - Resolver mode (default, ~63 KB/s, stealthier) and authoritative mode (~3.9 MB/s, exposes server IP)
  - ECDSA P-256 self-signed certificate generated during bootstrap
  - Full client support: cert distribution, client instructions, client-test, client-connect
  - Client guide (EN/FA) with protocol description and setup instructions
- **DNS Router** — Lightweight Go UDP forwarder for running multiple DNS tunnels on port 53
  - Routes DNS queries by domain suffix to dnstt or Slipstream backends
  - Supports single-backend mode (routes all traffic when only one tunnel is enabled)
- **`dnstunnel` Profile** — Unified profile for all DNS tunnel services (dns-router + dnstt + Slipstream)
  - Profile aliases: `dnstt`, `dns`, `slip`, `slipstream` all resolve to `dnstunnel`
  - Individual toggles: `ENABLE_DNSTT` and `ENABLE_SLIPSTREAM` control which backends are active
- **`moav logs` Profile Support** — `moav logs dnstunnel` now shows logs for all services in a profile (was silently failing for profile names)

### Fixed
- **Decoy Container Profile Mismatch** — `certbot` depends on `decoy`, but `decoy` was missing profiles (`wireguard`, `dnstunnel`, `trusttunnel`) causing `invalid compose project` errors when starting non-proxy profiles
- **Slipstream Binary on Alpine** — Pre-built Rust binaries are glibc-linked; Slipstream server switched to `debian:bookworm-slim`, client container uses `gcompat` + `libgcc` + `libc6-compat`

### Changed
- **`dnstt` Profile Renamed** — `dnstt` profile renamed to `dnstunnel` (backwards-compatible via alias)
- **dnstt Port Mapping** — dnstt no longer binds host port 53 directly; dns-router handles port 53 and routes to backends

## [1.3.8] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Decoy Website** — Interactive backgammon game replaces "Under Construction" page
  - Anti-fingerprinting: randomized titles, headings, footers, and color themes on each container start
  - 8 distinct color palettes, random hex comment to change file hash per deployment
  - Uses nginx `docker-entrypoint.d` mechanism with tmpfs for ephemeral randomized content
- **Connection Optimization Tips in User Bundle** — Inline per-protocol optimization guidance in README.html
  - Reality: TLS Fragment tip with Hiddify/v2rayNG settings, MUX warning (incompatible with Vision)
  - Trojan: TLS Fragment + MUX tips with app-specific values
  - CDN VLESS+WS: MUX tip, note that Fragment doesn't help (TLS at Cloudflare)
  - Hysteria2: no tips (QUIC, nothing to tweak)
- **Multi-user Revoke** — `moav user revoke` now accepts multiple usernames in one command
- **AmneziaWG Revoke** — User revoke now properly removes AmneziaWG peers

### Fixed
- **CDN Domain Empty in User Bundle** — `{{CDN_DOMAIN}}` in README.html was replaced with empty string
  - Root cause: `user-add.sh` and `generate-user.sh` didn't construct `CDN_DOMAIN` from `CDN_SUBDOMAIN` + `DOMAIN`
  - `singbox-user-add.sh` had the construction logic but it didn't propagate to the README generation
- **Certbot Port 80 Conflict** — Certbot standalone mode conflicted with decoy website on port 80
  - Switched certbot from `--standalone` to `--webroot` mode with shared ACME challenge volume
- **Decoy Container Not Picking Up Config** — `docker compose restart` doesn't apply compose file changes; documented need for `--force-recreate`

### Changed
- **sing-box** — Updated to v1.12.23
- **Decoy Website** — Now accessible on HTTP port 80 (was only internal)
- **Client Guide Docs** — Added Connection Optimization section to `docs/CLIENTS.md` (Fragment & MUX per-protocol table)

- **Build Optimization** — BuildKit cache mounts for Go compilation services
  - Go module and build caches persist across rebuilds (amneziawg, dnstt, snowflake, clash-exporter, client)
  - pip cache mount for admin image

### Fixed
- **Build Reliability** — Fixed Go services failing during parallel `moav build --no-cache`
  - Root cause: 13+ parallel builds saturated network, causing TLS handshake timeouts on Go module downloads
  - Fix: two-phase build — Go services built sequentially first, then remaining services in parallel
  - Phase 2 now filters to only buildable services (skips image-only services like certbot, grafana)
- **Go Version Pinning** — Fixed Dockerfile.amneziawg and Dockerfile.dnstt build failures
  - Pinned amneziawg-go to tag v0.2.16 (was cloning unpinned default branch)
  - Updated dnstt builder from `golang:1.21-alpine` to `golang:1.24-alpine` to match upstream `go.mod`

### Changed
- **Conduit Environment Variables** — `CONDUIT_MAX_CLIENTS` renamed to `CONDUIT_MAX_COMMON_CLIENTS` (backwards-compatible fallback in entrypoint)
- **Prometheus Scrape Target** — Conduit metrics now scraped directly from `psiphon-conduit:9090` (was `conduit-exporter:9101`)
- **Admin Dashboard** — Conduit stats section now shows per-region data from native metrics endpoint
- **Component Versions** — Updated Prometheus default to 3.10.0, sing-box 1.12.22, AmneziaWG tools 1.0.20260223

### Removed

  - WG IP allocation checks both config file and running interface
  - Fixed stale peers with `allowed ips: (none)` after re-bootstrap
- **Reality Public Key Derivation** - Fixed empty `pbk=` in Reality client configs
  - Bootstrap no longer clobbers public key when `sing-box generate reality-keypair --private-key` is unavailable
  - Falls back to `wg pubkey` for x25519 key derivation (same curve as WireGuard)
  - `singbox-user-add.sh` auto-derives and saves public key if missing from state
- **dnstt Public Key in README.html** - Fixed empty dnstt pubkey in generated README.html
  - `generate-user.sh` was reading from `dnstt-server.pub` instead of `dnstt-server.pub.hex`

## [1.3.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Conduit Exporter** - Custom Prometheus exporter for Psiphon Conduit metrics
  - Parses `[STATS]` lines from conduit logs

- **Bootstrap missing python3** - Added python3 to Dockerfile.bootstrap for placeholder replacement
- Stop/restart stopping extra services - Auto-adding proxy for dnstt now only happens during start

### Documentation
- Complete CLI.md reference with all moav commands and options
- SETUP.md: Added "Uninstalling MoaV" section, expanded "Breaking Changes" guidance
- TROUBLESHOOTING.md: Added "Breaking changes after update" section with solutions
- DNS.md: Added Cloudflare Origin Rule setup for CDN mode (fixes 521 errors)
- Updated uninstall documentation across all relevant docs

## [1.2.4] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **TrustTunnel VPN protocol integration** - Modern VPN protocol from AdGuard using HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 (QUIC)
  - New `trusttunnel` Docker service and profile
  - TrustTunnel endpoint on port 4443 (TCP+UDP)
  - Full TOML config generation for CLI client
  - TrustTunnel section in client guide (HTML) with all app fields
  - Admin dashboard: TrustTunnel service status and "TT" protocol tag for users
- TrustTunnel CLI client (`trusttunnel_client`) in client container for testing
- `moav start trusttunnel` and service menu option
- User bundles now include `trusttunnel.toml`, `trusttunnel.txt`, and `trusttunnel.json`

### Changed
- Client test gracefully falls back to endpoint reachability check when TUN device unavailable
- TrustTunnel app store links updated to correct URLs

### Fixed
- **README.html placeholder replacement broken** - Multiple issues fixed:
  - `local` variable used outside function causing script exit with `set -e`
  - sed `&` character interpreted as "matched pattern" in replacement strings
  - awk escape sequence warnings (`\&` treated as plain `&`)
  - Multiline WireGuard configs breaking sed commands
  - Now uses Python-based replacement for reliable handling of special characters and multiline content
- TrustTunnel CLI client requires `--config` flag (was missing)
- TrustTunnel credentials format: `[[client]]` not `[[credentials]]`, `[[main_hosts]]` not `[[hosts]]`

## [1.2.3] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **CDN-fronted VLESS+WebSocket inbound** - New protocol for Cloudflare CDN-proxied connections
  - sing-box `vless-ws-in` inbound on port 2082 (plain HTTP, Cloudflare terminates TLS)
  - Uses same user UUIDs as Reality (no extra credentials)
  - Client links generated when `CDN_DOMAIN` is set in `.env`
- `CDN_DOMAIN` config option - Set to your Cloudflare-proxied subdomain (e.g., `cdn.yourdomain.com`)
- `CDN_WS_PATH` config option - WebSocket path (default: `/ws`)
- `PORT_CDN` config option - CDN inbound port (default: `2082`, a Cloudflare-allowed HTTP port)
- User bundles now include `cdn-vless-ws.txt`, `cdn-vless-ws-singbox.json`, and QR code when CDN is configured
- Documentation: "Adding a Domain After Domainless Setup" guide in SETUP.md
- Documentation: Full CDN setup guide with Cloudflare configuration steps

### Changed
- `moav status` now displays CDN domain when configured
- User add message now mentions CDN VLESS+WS
- DNS.md Cloudflare section now includes optional `cdn` A record (Proxied)

### Fixed
- **`moav client connect` failing while `moav test` works** - Connect mode was missing IPv6 URI parsing, causing "invalid address" errors when IPv6 configs were present
  - `extract_host()` and `extract_port()` now handle IPv6 URIs (`@[addr]:port` format)
  - Config file discovery now prefers IPv4 configs (`reality.txt`) before falling back to globs (`reality*.txt`)
  - WireGuard endpoint parsing now handles IPv6 addresses
  - Added field validation with debug logging for all protocols
  - Added port numeric validation for Reality and Trojan (was only in test mode)

## [1.2.2] - 2026-02-04

### Breaking Changes
- **Fresh setup required**: This version includes protocol changes (Hysteria2 obfuscation, Reality target) that require regenerating both server configuration and all user configs. Existing users must receive new config files.

### Added
- **Hysteria2 Salamander obfuscation** - Disguises QUIC traffic as random UDP to bypass Iranian/Chinese censorship
- `HYSTERIA2_OBFS_PASSWORD` config option (auto-generated if empty)
- `moav config rebuild` - Regenerates server config and all users with new credentials
- Update available notification in CLI header and admin dashboard
- Admin dashboard: User bundles table now shows creation date, sorted newest first
- Internet accessibility check (exit IP verification) for all protocol tests
- Component version management via `.env` file

### Changed
- Default Reality target changed from `www.microsoft.com` to `dl.google.com` (less fingerprinted in censored regions)
- DNS fallback servers: removed Cloudflare DoH (failing), added Google UDP and Quad9 UDP
- `moav config rebuild` simplified - cleanly regenerates everything instead of complex state preservation
- Admin dashboard UI improvements

### Fixed
- **Critical: dnstt traffic not routing** - sing-box mixed inbound was localhost-only
- **Critical: Client container architecture mismatch** - Fixed arm64/amd64 binary downloads
- Admin dashboard crash on load (`connection_stats` undefined)
- `moav logs` Ctrl+C now returns to menu instead of exiting
- `moav logs proxy` and `moav logs reality` aliases for sing-box
- `moav regenerate-users` now passes Hysteria2 obfuscation password
- `moav test` various fixes for dnstt and validation
- `moav update` conflicts from generated files

### Security
- Hysteria2 obfuscation helps bypass QUIC fingerprinting and blocking in Iran/China

## [1.2.0] - 2026-02-03

### Added
- `moav update -b BRANCH` - switch git branches during update (e.g., `moav update -b dev`)
- Profile aliases for `moav start`: `sing-box`, `singbox`, `reality`, `trojan`, `hysteria` → `proxy`
- Service aliases for restart/stop/logs: `proxy`, `reality` → `sing-box`
- Branch display in header and status when not on `main` branch
- `moav test` verbose flag (`-v` or `--verbose`) for debugging connection issues
- Multiple fallback DNS servers in sing-box config (Google, Cloudflare, Quad9 UDP)

### Changed
- `moav update` now shows help with `--help` flag
- `moav test` now prefers IPv4 configs over IPv6 (tests `reality.txt` before `reality-ipv6.txt`)
- `moav test` treats IPv6 network failures as warnings instead of errors (IPv6 may not be available in container)
- Improved gitignore for generated WireGuard and dnstt files

### Fixed
- `moav update -b BRANCH` arguments not being passed correctly
- Double header display when running `moav` interactive menu
- Script permissions (755) for all shell scripts in repository
- Generated files (server.pub, wg_confs/, coredns/) no longer trigger update conflicts
- **WireGuard-wstunnel not forwarding traffic** - wstunnel was trying to forward to localhost instead of wireguard container (changed `127.0.0.1:51820` to `moav-wireguard:51820`)
- `moav test` now correctly parses IPv6 addresses in URIs (e.g., `[2400:6180::1]:443`)
- `moav test` now validates parsed URI fields before generating config
- `moav test` now shows actual sing-box error messages instead of generic "failed to start"
- `moav test` now validates generated JSON config before running sing-box

### Changed
- Improved sing-box performance: disabled `sniff_override_destination`, disabled multiplex padding, enabled TCP Fast Open, use local DNS by default
- WireGuard entrypoint bypasses wg-quick to avoid Docker 29 compatibility issues
- WireGuard peer IP assignment now based on peer count (fixes demouser getting server IP)
- Service selection "ALL" now respects ENABLE_* settings (only starts enabled services)
- `moav stop` now uses `docker compose stop` instead of `down` (preserves container state)
- Certbot exits gracefully when no domain configured (domain-less mode)

### Fixed
- Admin dashboard using self-signed cert instead of Let's Encrypt (now waits for certbot)
- Admin dashboard "sing-box API timeout" error (memory endpoint is streaming, now reads first line only)
- WireGuard traffic not flowing (missing iptables FORWARD rule for return traffic)
- WireGuard "Permission denied" error on Docker 29 with Alpine
